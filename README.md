*Okay...not yet, but I'm getting there, one line of code at the time.*

ðŸŒ± I am a **web developer from France** with a passion for **art**, **coding** and **video games**. The more I learn about any of these subjects, the better!

On here, you will find some repos meant for class purpose only (exercizes repos) most of them private but some might escape my attention, and some personal and class projects, with more elaborate stuff. 
Most of it is going to be documented (because I love myself some writing) and, at least for now, most of it is going to be in JavaScript, React JS and Node JS, because it is what I know best and what I study. But I'm open to learn more.
I'm all about refinement; I'd rather do less but good, than a lot poorly. That goes for development and for my art too.

So far, I worked on two class projects, and a third one is in the hoven:

1/ **Wildcards** - [an HTML, CSS and a pinch of JavaScript single page website](https://wildcodeschool.github.io/Lyon-js-202005-project-Trombino/). It's not super responsive, but it is a cool little yearbook that we did after two weeks of learning code; the simple modal was already a challenge at the time.

2/ **Gamovore** - [a dynamic desktop first app made with ReactJS and Firebase](https://gamovore.netlify.app/), that aims to connect gamers using the games they own. I work mostly on the API calls using axios, the filters system, the logo and a lot of UX, and UI.

:video_game: As much as I enjoy web development (and I thouroughly enjoy it...like A LOT) my love for video games sometimes still takes the better of me.

I have three personal game projects on the back burner:

![Jumping JS](https://i.imgur.com/GP8HGm8.gif)
1/ ***Jumper JS aka Seb's Adventure*** - a [pure JS infinite runner](https://github.com/Seblecaribou/Jumping-JS) where you jump on a bike above ducks in the streets of Lyon. It's already functional, you can [play it](https://seblecaribou.github.io/Jumping-JS/), there is a score system, but it lacks nuances in the gameplay, and the hitbox system is not great. I need to fix it and add a couple of mechanics. Infos in the Readme.

![Private Space Invader](https://i.imgur.com/CWkMvNU.gif)
2/ ***Private Space Invader*** - a pure JS game where you try to deliver papers to your boss while escaping your collegues germs in time of Covid (I promise it's not going to be as demoralising as it sounds). It's essentially a learning tool for HTML canvas and their use with Javascript. It's not far enough to have a public repo yet, but I'm getting there.

![The Last Case](https://i.imgur.com/pjWP2EY.gif)
3/ ***The Last Case*** - an adventure game, made with Game Maker Studio 1. I started it a while ago, when I wasn't coding yet and I really want to finish it. It's a very short detective game, set in a single apartment with multiple endings. Most of the mechanics are already there, but I need to polish it a lot. And I'm still working on how to version it properly.
